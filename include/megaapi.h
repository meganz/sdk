 * @brief Interface to provide an external GFX processor
 *
 * You can implement this interface to provide a graphics processor to the SDK
 * in the MegaApi::MegaApi constructor. That way, SDK will use your implementation to generate
 * thumbnails/previews when needed.
 *
 * Images will be sequentially processed. At first, the SDK will call MegaGfxProcessor::readBitmap
 * with the path of the file. Then, it will call MegaGfxProcessor::getWidth and MegaGfxProcessor::getHeight
 * to get the dimensions of the file (in pixels). After that, the SDK will call
 * MegaGfxProcessor::getBitmapDataSize and MegaGfxProcessor::getBitmapData in a loop
 * to get thumbnails/previews of different sizes. Finally, the SDK will call
 * MegaGfxProcessor::freeBitmap to let you free the resources required to process
 * the current file.
 *
 * If the image has EXIF data, it should be rotated/mirrored before doing any
 * other processing. MegaGfxProcessor::getWidth, MegaGfxProcessor::getHeight and all
 * other coordinates in this interface are expressed over the image after the required
 * transformation based on the EXIF data.
 *
 * Generated images must be in JPG format.

 * You can enable local node caching by passing a local path in the constructor of this class. That saves many data usage
 * and many time starting your app because the entire filesystem won't have to be downloaded each time. The persistent
 * node cache will only be loaded by logging in with a session key. To take advantage of this feature, apart of passing the
 * local path to the constructor, your application have to save the session key after login (MegaApi::dumpSession) and use
 * it to log in the next time. This is highly recommended also to enhance the security, because in this was the access password
 * doesn't have to be stored by the application.
 *
 * To access MEGA using this SDK, you have to create an object of this class and use one of the MegaApi::login options (to log in
 * to a MEGA account or a public folder). If the login request succeed, you must call MegaApi::fetchNodes to get the filesystem in MEGA.
 * After successfully completing that request, you can use all other functions, manage the files and start transfers.
 *
 * After using MegaApi::logout you can reuse the same MegaApi object to log in to another MEGA account or a public folder.
 *
 * Some functions in this class return a pointer and give you the ownership. In all of them, memory allocations
 * are made using new (for single objects) and new[] (for arrays) so you should use delete and delete[] to free them.
