/**
 * @brief Interface to provide an external GFX processor
 *
 * You can implement this interface to provide a graphics processor to the SDK
 * in the MegaApi::MegaApi constructor. That way, SDK will use your implementation to generate
 * thumbnails/previews when needed.
 *
 * The implementation will receive callbacks from an internal worker thread.
 *
 * Images will be sequentially processed. At first, the SDK will call MegaGfxProcessor::readBitmap
 * with the path of the file. Then, it will call MegaGfxProcessor::getWidth and MegaGfxProcessor::getHeight
 * to get the dimensions of the file (in pixels). After that, the SDK will call
 * MegaGfxProcessor::getBitmapDataSize and MegaGfxProcessor::getBitmapData in a loop
 * to get thumbnails/previews of different sizes. Finally, the SDK will call
 * MegaGfxProcessor::freeBitmap to let you free the resources required to process
 * the current file.
 *
 * If the image has EXIF data, it should be rotated/mirrored before doing any
 * other processing. MegaGfxProcessor::getWidth, MegaGfxProcessor::getHeight and all
 * other coordinates in this interface are expressed over the image after the required
 * transformation based on the EXIF data.
 *
 * Generated images must be in JPG format.

         *      - MegaEvent::getText: email address used to confirm the account
         *
         *  - MegaEvent::EVENT_CONFIRM_USER_EMAIL: when a new account is finally confirmed

         *      - MegaEvent::getText: email address used to confirm the account

         * reached using HTTP or that HTTP communications are being tampered. Transfers of files and

         * receiving this event reset its connections with other servers, since the disconnect
         * performed by the SDK is due to a network change or IP addresses becoming invalid.
         *
         *  - MegaEvent::EVENT_ACCOUNT_BLOCKED: when the account get blocked, typically because of
         * infringement of the Mega's terms of service repeatedly. This event is followed by an automatic
         * logout, except for the temporary blockings (ACCOUNT_BLOCKED_VERIFICATION_SMS and

 * node cache will only be loaded by logging in with a session key. To take advantage of this feature, apart of passing the
 * local path to the constructor, your application have to save the session key after login (MegaApi::dumpSession) and use
 * it to log in the next time. This is highly recommended also to enhance the security, because in this was the access password
 * doesn't have to be stored by the application.
 *
 * To access MEGA using this SDK, you have to create an object of this class and use one of the MegaApi::login options (to log in
 * to a MEGA account or a public folder). If the login request succeed, you must call MegaApi::fetchNodes to get the filesystem in MEGA.
 * After successfully completing that request, you can use all other functions, manage the files and start transfers.
 *
 * After using MegaApi::logout you can reuse the same MegaApi object to log in to another MEGA account or a public folder.
 *
 * Some functions in this class return a pointer and give you the ownership. In all of them, memory allocations
 * are made using new (for single objects) and new[] (for arrays) so you should use delete and delete[] to free them.

         * fails again. For this reason, and since this request is very lightweight, it's recommended to call it with
         * the default parameters on every user interaction with the application. This will prevent very big delays
         * completing requests.
         *

         * @param disconnect true if you want to disconnect already connected requests
         * It's not recommended to set this flag to true if you are not fully sure about what are you doing. If you
         * send a request that needs some time to complete and you disconnect it in a loop without giving it enough time,
         * it could be retrying forever.
         * Using true in this parameter will trigger the callback MegaGlobalListener::onEvent and the callback
         * MegaListener::onEvent with the event type MegaEvent::EVENT_DISCONNECT.
         *
         * @param includexfers true to retry also transfers
         * It's not recommended to set this flag. Transfer has a retry counter and are aborted after a number of retries
