/**
 * The details about the event, like the type of event and optionally any
 * additional parameter, is received in the \c params parameter.
 *
 * You can check the type of event by calling [MEGAEvent type]
 *
 * Currently, the following type of events are notified:
 *
 *  - EventCommitDB: when the SDK commits the ongoing DB transaction.
 *  This event can be used to keep synchronization between the SDK cache and the
 *  cache managed by the app thanks to the sequence number.
 *
 *  Valid data in the MegaEvent object received in the callback:
 *      - [MEGAEvent text]: sequence number recorded by the SDK when this event happened
 *
 *  - EventAccountConfirmation: when a new account is finally confirmed
 *  by the user by confirming the signup link.
 *
 *  Valid data in the MegaEvent object received in the callback:
 *      - [MEGAEvent text]: email address used to confirm the account
 *
 *  - EventChangeToHttps: when the SDK automatically starts using HTTPS for all
 *  its communications. This happens when the SDK is able to detect that MEGA servers can't be
 *  reached using HTTP or that HTTP communications are being tampered. Transfers of files and
 *  file attributes (thumbnails and previews) use HTTP by default to save CPU usage. Since all data
 *  is already end-to-end encrypted, it's only needed to use HTTPS if HTTP doesn't work. Anyway,
 *  applications can force the SDK to always use HTTPS using MegaApi::useHttpsOnly. It's recommended
 *  that applications that receive one of these events save that information on its settings and
 *  automatically enable HTTPS on next executions of the app to not force the SDK to detect the problem
 *  and automatically switch to HTTPS every time that the application starts.
 *
 * - EventDisconnect: when the SDK performs a disconnect to reset all the
 * existing open-connections, since they have become unusable. It's recommended that the app
 * receiving this event reset its connections with other servers, since the disconnect
 * performed by the SDK is due to a network change or IP addresses becoming invalid.
 *
 * - EventAccountBlocked: when the account get blocked, typically because of
 * infringement of the Mega's terms of service repeatedly. This event is followed by an automatic
 * logout.
 *
 *  Valid data in the MegaEvent object received in the callback:
 *      - [MEGAEvent text]: message to show to the user.
 *      - [MEGAEvent number]: code representing the reason for being blocked.
 *          200: suspension message for any type of suspension, but copyright suspension.
 *          300: suspension only for multiple copyright violations.
 *          400: the subuser account has been disabled.
 *          401: the subuser account has been removed.
 *          500: The account needs to be verified by an SMS code.
 *          700: the account is supended for Weak Account Protection.
 *
 * - EventStorage: when the status of the storage changes.
 *
 * For this event type, MegaEvent::getNumber provides the current status of the storage
 *
 * There are three possible storage states:
 *     - StorageStateGreen = 0
 *     There are no storage problems
 *
 *     - StorageStateOrange = 1
 *     The account is almost full
 *
 *     - StorageStateRed = 2
 *     The account is full. Uploads have been stopped
 *
 *     - StorageStateChange = 3
 *     There is a possible significant change in the storage state.
 *     It's needed to call [MEGASdk getAccountDetails] to check the storage status.
 *     After calling it, this callback will be called again with the corresponding
 *     state if there is really a change.
 *
 * - EventNodesCurrent: when all external changes have been received
 *
 * - EventMediaInfoReady: when codec-mappings have been received
 *
 * - EventBusinessStatus: when the status of a business account has changed.
 * The posible values are:
 *   - BusinessStatusExpired = -1
 *   - BusinessStatusInactive = 0
 *   - BusinessStatusActive = 1
 *   - BusinessStatusGracePeriod = 2
 *
 *  Valid data in the MEGAEvent object received in the callback:
 *    - [MEGAEvent number] returns the new business status.
