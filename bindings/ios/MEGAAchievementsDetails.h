/**
 * @brief The MEGAAchievementsDetails class
 *
 * There are several MEGA Achievements that a user can unlock, resulting in a
 * temporary extension of the storage and/or transfer quota during a period of
 * time.
 *
 * Currently there are 4 different classes of MEGA Achievements:
 *
 *  - Welcome: Create your free account and get 35 GB of complimentary storage space,
 *      valid for 30 days.
 *
 *  - Invite: Invite as many friends or coworkers as you want. For every signup under the
 *      invited email address, you will receive 10 GB of complimentary storage plus 20 GB
 *      of transfer quota, both valid for 365 days, provided that the new user installs
 *      either MEGAsync or a mobile app and starts using MEGA.
 *
 *  - Desktop install: When you install MEGAsync you get 20 GB of complimentary storage
 *      space plus 40 GB of transfer quota, both valid for 180 days.
 *
 *  - Mobile install: When you install our mobile app you get 15 GB of complimentary
 *      storage space plus 30 GB transfer quota, both valid for 180 days.
 *
 * When the user unlocks one of the achievements above, it unlocks an "Award". The award
 * includes a timestamps to indicate when it was unlocked, plus an expiration timestamp.
 * Afterwards, the award will not be active. Additionally, each award results in a "Reward".
 * The reward is linked to the corresponding award and includes the storage and transfer
 * quota obtained thanks to the unlocked award.
 *
 * @note It may take 2-3 days for achievements to show on the account after they have been completed.
