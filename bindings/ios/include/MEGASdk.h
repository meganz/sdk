/**
 * @brief Allows to control a MEGA account or a public folder.
 *
 * You must provide an appKey to use this SDK. You can generate an appKey for your app for free here:
 * - https://mega.co.nz/#sdk
 *
 * You can enable local node caching by passing a local path in the constructor of this class. That saves many data usage
 * and many time starting your app because the entire filesystem won't have to be downloaded each time. The persistent
 * node cache will only be loaded by logging in with a session key. To take advantage of this feature, apart of passing the
 * local path to the constructor, your application have to save the session key after login ([MEGASdk dumpSession]) and use
 * it to log in the next time. This is highly recommended also to enhance the security, because in this was the access password
 * doesn't have to be stored by the application.
 *
 * To access MEGA using this SDK, you have to create an object of this class and use one of the [MEGASdk loginWithEmail:password:]
 * options (to log in to a MEGA account or a public folder). If the login request succeed, you must call [MEGASdk fetchnodes] to get the
 * filesystem in MEGA.
 * After that, you can use all other requests, manage the files and start transfers.
 *
 * After using [MEGASdk logout] you can reuse the same MEGASdk object to log in to another MEGA account or a public folder.
