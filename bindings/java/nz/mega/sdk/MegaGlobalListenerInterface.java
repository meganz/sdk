    /**
     * The details about the event, like the type of event and optionally any
     * additional parameter, is received in the \c params parameter.
     *
     * You can check the type of event by calling MegaEvent::getType
     *
     * The SDK retains the ownership of the details of the event (\c event).
     * Don't use them after this functions returns.
     *
     * Currently, the following type of events are notified:
     *
     *  - MegaEvent::EVENT_COMMIT_DB: when the SDK commits the ongoing DB transaction.
     *  This event can be used to keep synchronization between the SDK cache and the
     *  cache managed by the app thanks to the sequence number.
     *
     *  Valid data in the MegaEvent object received in the callback:
     *      - MegaEvent::getText: sequence number recorded by the SDK when this event happened
     *
     *  - MegaEvent::EVENT_ACCOUNT_CONFIRMATION: when a new account is finally confirmed
     * by the user by confirming the signup link.
     *
     *   Valid data in the MegaEvent object received in the callback:
     *      - MegaEvent::getText: email address used to confirm the account
     *
     *  - MegaEvent::EVENT_CHANGE_TO_HTTPS: when the SDK automatically starts using HTTPS for all
     * its communications. This happens when the SDK is able to detect that MEGA servers can't be
     * reached using HTTP or that HTTP communications are being tampered. Transfers of files and
     * file attributes (thumbnails and previews) use HTTP by default to save CPU usage. Since all data
     * is already end-to-end encrypted, it's only needed to use HTTPS if HTTP doesn't work. Anyway,
     * applications can force the SDK to always use HTTPS using MegaApi::useHttpsOnly. It's recommended
     * that applications that receive one of these events save that information on its settings and
     * automatically enable HTTPS on next executions of the app to not force the SDK to detect the problem
     * and automatically switch to HTTPS every time that the application starts.
     *
     *  - MegaEvent::EVENT_DISCONNECT: when the SDK performs a disconnect to reset all the
     * existing open-connections, since they have become unusable. It's recommended that the app
     * receiving this event reset its connections with other servers, since the disconnect
     * performed by the SDK is due to a network change or IP addresses becoming invalid.
     *
     *  - MegaEvent::EVENT_ACCOUNT_BLOCKED: when the account get blocked, typically because of
     * infringement of the Mega's terms of service repeatedly. This event is followed by an automatic
     * logout.
     *
     *  Valid data in the MegaEvent object received in the callback:
     *      - MegaEvent::getText: message to show to the user.
     *      - MegaEvent::getNumber: code representing the reason for being blocked.
     *          200: suspension message for any type of suspension, but copyright suspension.
     *          300: suspension only for multiple copyright violations.
     *          400: the subuser account has been disabled.
     *          401: the subuser account has been removed.
     *
     * - MegaEvent::EVENT_STORAGE: when the status of the storage changes.
     *
     * For this event type, MegaEvent::getNumber provides the current status of the storage
     *
     * There are three possible storage states:
     *     - MegaApi::STORAGE_STATE_GREEN = 0
     *     There are no storage problems
     *
     *     - MegaApi::STORAGE_STATE_ORANGE = 1
     *     The account is almost full
     *
     *     - MegaApi::STORAGE_STATE_RED = 2
     *     The account is full. Uploads have been stopped
     *
     *     - MegaApi::STORAGE_STATE_CHANGE = 3
     *     There is a possible significant change in the storage state.
     *     It's needed to call MegaApi::getAccountDetails to check the storage status.
     *     After calling it, this callback will be called again with the corresponding
     *     state if there is really a change.
     *
     * - MegaEvent::EVENT_NODES_CURRENT: when all external changes have been received
     *
     * - MegaEvent::EVENT_MEDIA_INFO_READY: when codec-mappings have been received
     *
     * - MegaEvent::EVENT_STORAGE_SUM_CHANGED: when the storage sum has changed.
     *
     * For this event type, MegaEvent::getNumber provides the new storage sum.
     *
     * - MegaEvent::EVENT_BUSINESS_STATUS: when the status of a business account has changed.
     *
     * For this event type, MegaEvent::getNumber provides the new business status.
     *
     * The posible values are:
     *  - BUSINESS_STATUS_EXPIRED = -1
     *  - BUSINESS_STATUS_INACTIVE = 0
     *  - BUSINESS_STATUS_ACTIVE = 1
     *  - BUSINESS_STATUS_GRACE_PERIOD = 2
     *
     * - MegaEvent::EVENT_KEY_MODIFIED: when the key of a user has changed.
     *
     * For this event type, MegaEvent::getHandle provides the handle of the user whose key has been modified.
     * For this event type, MegaEvent::getNumber provides type of key that has been modified.
     *
     * The possible values are:
     *  - Public chat key (Cu25519)     = 0
     *  - Public signing key (Ed25519)  = 1
     *  - Public RSA key                = 2
     *  - Signature of chat key         = 3
     *  - Signature of RSA key          = 4
     *
     * - MegaEvent::EVENT_GLOBAL_FLAGS_READY: when the global flags are available/updated.
     *
