MEGA LIMITED TERMS OF SERVICE ("TERMS")
1. Welcome to MEGA. We are an Internet services provider and provide services made available at our website at https://mega.nz, subdomains and related sites ("website"), which enables users (depending which MEGA plan they are on), amongst other things, to encrypt by way of user controlled encryption ("UCE"), use our application programming interface ("API"), upload, store, manage, download and decrypt files, information, material and other data ("data") and give access to that data to others (all together, services). If you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, see our FAQ first.
2. These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services and website by you and anyone that you allow to access your data or our services. By using our services or the website, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms. If you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound, you can't use our services and the website.
3. We can change these terms at any time and we will provide you notice of the change, whether via our website, by sending you an email or via any messaging service we provide. Your continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.
4. If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our service via the website in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.

Your data

5. If you allow others to access your data (e.g. by, amongst other things, giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using the website and services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.
6. Our service includes UCE. You should keep your encryption keys safe and confidential and not release them to anyone unless you wish them to have access to your data. If you lose or misplace your encryption keys, you will lose access to your data. We strongly urge you to use robust anti-virus and firewall protection.
7. You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our service. We do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free. You are completely responsible to remove all data prior to termination of services.
8. Our service may automatically delete a piece of data you upload or give someone else access to where it determines that that data is an exact duplicate of original data already on our service. In that case, you will access that original data.
9. We will store your data on our service subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to. If you choose to stop using our services, you need to make sure you retrieve your data first because, after that, we may, if we wish, delete it. If we suspend our services to you because you or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension, we may if we wish deny you access to your data. If we terminate our services to you because you or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, we may if we wish delete your data immediately. In circumstances where we cease providing all our services for other reasons, we will, if reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law from doing so, give you 30 days access to retrieve your data.

What does it cost you?

10. Once you have purchased a plan for our services, you need to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties). We can also change the fees for our services at any time if we give you notice. You can't withhold payment for any reason or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.
11. If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you)...
11.1 ...make you pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you. You will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you; and/or
11.2 ...suspend or terminate your use of the service.
12. You must:
12.1 make sure you always give us and keep up to date your correct contact and billing details, particularly if these change;
12.2 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us;
